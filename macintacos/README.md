# [macintacos](github.com/macintacos) Config

There are two files that make up my configuration for ease of iteration:

1. `vspacecode-config.json` - contains actual VSpaceCode overrides.
2. `other-config.json` - contains "other settings" needed to make sure the aforementioned VSpaceCode overrides work as expected.
3. `keybindings.json` - contains keybindings that make more "escape hatches" possible so that you can use `SPC` to invoke VSpaceCode pretty much anywhere.

## Setup

### Extension Settings

The actual overrides are in `vspacecode-config.json`, however there is some additional settings/extensions needed to get every command to behave the way I expect which are defined in `other-config.json`.

- I use [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim). `vim.visualModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive` and `vim.normalModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive` have the `vspacecode.space` invocation set to `<space>`. 90% of the time this isn't a problem â€“ for the other 10%, vote for: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/103845.
- I use [Settings Cycler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.vscode-settings-cycler) for cycling through line number types; there's probably an easier solution for this but I haven't found it.
- There's some minor configuration for `whichkey` (I added a delay because if I know the chord I don't need the menu to render really).

### Keyboard Settings

You can use `keybindings.json` to augment your existing keybindings. Because I use just the `SPC` key to invoke `vspacecode.space`, I need to have various "escape hatches" to get out of places where VSCode interprets you hitting the `SPC` key to mean "insert a space" instead of "invoke VSpaceCode". With this set of keybindings:

- Hitting `tab`/`shift-tab` will kick you to the next/previous "group". In this implementation, you can think of a "group" to also mean the sidebar, which means that using `tab`/`shift+tab` will also navigate you out of the sidebar. Unfortunately this does not include the bottom panel. These keys do the same when you're in `normal` mode in VSCodeVim.
- Hitting `escape` _for the most part_ will get you out of whatever text field you're in an put you somewhere that, when you hit `SPC`, you'll invoke VSpaceCode. This doesn't have a 100% hit rate.
- `ctrl+space` is there to invoke the extension in case you really can't get out of where you're currently at. Currently it doesn't seem to work in the terminal, but I think that's a bug.

Unfortunately even with these keybindings, I haven't been able to achieve 100% reliability. Please vote for this issue if you'd like this to be a bit "simpler" and have a global "lose focus" command: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/103845

## Caveats

- I don't use `edmagit`, so my `SPC g ...` commands are custom made and will likely stay that way. I lived without `magit` for a bit too long when I switched to VSCode, so I just got used to my Sublime Merge workflow.
- As mentioned in the Setup, I use VSCodeVim, and a few things in my config is expecting that extension to be in use.
- I use _probably_ too many extensions, so you're going to have to do some downloading if you want to steal this whole config.

Copy/paste at your own risk.
