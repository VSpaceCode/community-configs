# [macintacos](github.com/macintacos) Config

There are two files that make up my configuration for ease of iteration:

1. `vspacecode-config.json` - contains actual VSpaceCode overrides
2. `other-config.json` - contains "other settings" needed to make sure the aforementioned VSpaceCode overrides work as expected.

## Setup

The actual overrides are in `vspacecode-config.json`, however there is some additional settings/extensions needed to get every command to behave the way I expect which are defined in `other-config.json`.

- I use [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim). `vim.visualModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive` and `vim.normalModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive` have the `vspacecode.space` invocation set to `<space>`. 90% of the time this isn't a problem â€“ for the other 10%, vote for: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/103845.
- I use [multi-command](https://github.com/ryuta46/vscode-multi-command). There is an array of `multiCommand.commands` that are used later on in the overrides.
- I use [Settings Cycler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.vscode-settings-cycler) for cycling through line number types; there's probably an easier solution for this but I haven't found it.
- There's some minor configuration for `whichkey` (I added a delay because if I know the chord I don't need the menu to render really).

## Caveats

- I don't use `edmagit`, so my `SPC g ...` commands are custom made and will likely stay that way. I lived without `magit` for a bit too long when I switched to VSCode, so I just got used to my Sublime Merge workflow.
- I use _probably_ too many extensions, so you're going to have to do some downloading if you want to steal this whole config.

Copy/paste at your own risk.
